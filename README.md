# namer_app

A new Flutter project which generates funny names as a name pair in a random manner. I built this project while i was taking a course collected by google flutter's developers team. Just take the whole code and run it on your machine and its very helpful especially if you are new to flutter.

This project is a kinda starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
HAPPY CODING!!!!!!!!
